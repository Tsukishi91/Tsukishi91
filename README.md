Hi everyone ! My name is Denis. Currently working as a paramedic. I have a Bachelors degree in EMS. I always had the dream of becoming a doctor. Because of money issues I settled in my current position. I'm a code enthusiast and always wanted to learn how to code and create. After a long thinking, I've decided that I want to turn my enthusiasm into profession. 
Just started learning Full-Stack not long ago. Hoping for a good learning and great self development!
I'm interested in learning Full-Stack development. The most interesting part for me right now is Front-End. Hoping to master this side of web dev and continue on to master Back-End!
Currently I'm learning an online course of Full-Stack. Started not long ago. Hoping to reach hights as soon as possible.
Overall, I have a very basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
